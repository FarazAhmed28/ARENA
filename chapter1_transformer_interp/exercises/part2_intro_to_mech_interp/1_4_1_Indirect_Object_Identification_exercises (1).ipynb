Sections 1, 2 & 3 are derived from Neel Nanda's notebook [Exploratory_Analysis_Demo](https://colab.research.google.com/github/TransformerLensOrg/TransformerLens/blob/main/demos/Exploratory_Analysis_Demo.ipynb#scrollTo=WXktSe0CvBdh). The flavour of these exercises is experimental and loose, with a focus on demonstrating what exploratory analysis looks like in practice with the transformerlens library. They skimp on rigour, and instead try to speedrun the process of finding suggestive evidence for this circuit. The code and exercises are simple and generic, but accompanied with a lot of detail about what each stage is doing, and why (plus several optional details and tangents). Section 4 introduces you to the idea of **path patching**, which is a more rigorous and structured way of analysing the model's behaviour. Here, you'll be replicating some of the results of the paper, which will serve to rigorously validate the insights gained from earlier sections. It's the most technically dense of all five sections. Lastly, sections 5 & 6 are much less structured, and have a stronger focus on open-ended exercises & letting you go off and explore for yourself.\n",

        "A key idea to have in mind during these exercises is the **spectrum from simpler, more exploratory tools to more rigoruous, complex tools**. On the simpler side, you have something like inspecting attention patterns, which can give a decent (but sometimes misleading) picture of what an attention head is doing. These should be some of the first tools you reach for, and you should be using them a lot even before you have concrete hypotheses about a circuit. On the more rigorous side, you have something like path patching, which is a pretty rigorous and effortful tool that is best used when you already have reasonably concrete hypotheses about a circuit. As we go through the exercises, we'll transition from left to right along this spectrum."

        "\n",
        "The first step when trying to reverse engineer a circuit in a model is to identify *what* capability we want to reverse engineer. Indirect Object Identification is a task studied in Redwood Research's excellent [Interpretability in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00593) paper (see [Neel Nanda's interview with the authors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzwj0jWbvbo) or [Kevin Wang's Twitter thread](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1587601532639494146.html) for an overview). The task is to complete sentences like \"When Mary and John went to the store, John gave a drink to\" with \" Mary\" rather than \" John\".\n",
        "\n",
        "In the paper they rigorously reverse engineer a 26 head circuit, with 7 separate categories of heads used to perform this capability. The circuit they found roughly breaks down into three parts:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Identify what names are in the sentence\n",
        "2. Identify which names are duplicated\n",
        "3. Predict the name that is *not* duplicated\n",
        "\n",
        "Why was this task chosen? The authors give a very good explanation for their choice in their [video walkthrough of their paper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzwj0jWbvbo), which you are encouraged to watch. To be brief, some of the reasons were:\n",
        "\n",
        "* This is a fairly common grammatical structure, so we should expect the model to build some circuitry for solving it quite early on (after it's finished with all the more basic stuff, like n-grams, punctuation, induction, and simpler grammatical structures than this one).\n",
        "* It's easy to measure: the model always puts a much higher probability on the IO and S tokens (i.e. `\" Mary\"` and `\" John\"`) than any others, and this is especially true once the model starts being stripped down to the core part of the circuit we're studying. So we can just take the logit difference between these two tokens, and use this as a metric for how well the model can solve the task.\n",
        "* It is a crisp and well-defined task, so less likely to be solved in terms of memorisation of a large bag of heuristics (unlike e.g. tasks like \"predict that the number `n+1` will follow `n`, which as Neel mentions in the video walkthrough is actually much more annoying and subtle than it first seems!).\n",
        "\n",
        "A terminology note: `IO` will refer to the indirect object (in the example, `\" Mary\"`), `S1` and `S2` will refer to the two instances of the subject token (i.e. `\" John\"`), and `end` will refer to the end token `\" to\"` (because this is the position we take our prediction from, and we don't care about any tokens after this point). We will also sometimes use `S` to refer to the identity of the subject token (rather than referring to the first or second instance in particular)."

You are recommended to keep a document or page of notes nearby as you go through these exercises, so you can keep track of the main takeaways from each section, as well as your hypotheses for how the model performs the task, and your ideas for how you might go off and test these hypotheses on your own if the notebook were to suddenly end.\n",

Imagine a line of people, who can only look forward. Each person has a token written on their chest, and their goal is to figure out what token the person in front of them is holding. Each person is allowed to pass a question backwards along the line (not forwards), and anyone can choose to reply to that question by passing information forwards to the person who asked. In this case, the sentence is `\"When Mary and John went to the store, John gave a drink to Mary\"`. You are the person holding the `\" to\"` token, and your goal is to figure out that the person in front of him has the `\" Mary\"` token.\n",
        "\n",
        "To be clear about how this analogy relates to transformers:\n",
        "* Each person in the line represents a vector in the residual stream. Initially they just store their own token, but they accrue more information as they ask questions and receive answers (i.e. as components write to the residual stream)\n",
        "* The operation of an attention head is represented by a question & answer:\n",
        "    * The person who asks is the destination token, the people who answer are the source tokens\n",
        "    * The question is the query vector\n",
        "    * The information *which determines who answers the question* is the key vector\n",
        "    * The information *which gets passed back to the original asker* is the value vector\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, here is how the IOI circuit works in this analogy. Each bullet point represents a class of attention heads.\n",
        "\n",
        "* The person with the second `\" John\"` token asks the question \"does anyone else hold the name `\" John\"`?\". They get a reply from the first `\" John\"` token, who also gives him their location. So he now knows that `\" John\"` is repeated, and he knows that the first `\" John\"` token is 4th in the sequence.\n",
        "    * These are *Duplicate Token Heads*\n",
        "* You ask the question \"which names are repeated?\", and you get an answer from the person holding the second `\" John\"` token. You now also know that `\" John\"` is repeated, and where the first `\" John\"` token is.\n",
        "    * These are *S-Inhibition Heads*\n",
        "* You ask the question \"does anyone have a name that isn't `\" John\"`, and isn't at the 4th position in the sequence?\". You get a reply from the person holding the `\" Mary\"` token, who tells you that they have name `\" Mary\"`. You use this as your prediction.\n",
        "    * These are *Name Mover Heads*\n",
        "\n",
        "This is a fine first-pass understanding of how the circuit works. A few other features:\n",
        "\n",
        "* The person after the first `\" John\"` (holding `\" went\"`) had previously asked about the identity of the person behind him. So he knows that the 4th person in the sequence holds the `\" John\"` token, meaning he can also reply to the question of the person holding the second `\" John\"` token. *(previous token heads / induction heads)*\n",
        "    * This might not seem necessary, but since previous token heads / induction heads are just a pretty useful thing to have in general, it makes sense that you'd want to make use of this information!\n",
        "* If for some reason you forget to ask the question \"does anyone have a name that isn't `\" John\"`, and isn't at the 4th position in the sequence?\", then you'll have another chance to do this.\n",
        "    * These are *(Backup Name Mover Heads)*\n",
        "    * Their existance might be partly because transformers are trained with **dropout**. This can make them \"forget\" things, so it's important to have a backup method for recovering that information!\n",
        "* You want to avoid overconfidence, so you also ask the question \"does anyone have a name that isn't `\" John\"`, and isn't at the 4th position in the sequence?\" another time, in order to ***anti-***predict the response that you get from this question. *(negative name mover heads)*\n",

        "\n",
        "For example, we know that instead of working with $W_Q$ and $W_K$ individually, the only matrix we actually need to use in the model is the low-rank matrix $W_Q W_K^T$ (note that I'm using the convention of matrix multiplication on the right, which matches the code in transformerlens and previous exercises in this series, but doesn't match Anthropic's Mathematical Frameworks paper). So if we perform singular value decomposition $W_Q W_K^T = U S V^T$, then we see that we can just as easily define $W_Q = U \\sqrt{S}$ and $W_K = V \\sqrt{S}$ and use these instead. This means that $W_Q$ and $W_K$ both have orthogonal columns with matching norms. You can investigate this yourself (e.g. using the code below). This is arguably a more interpretable setup, because now there's no obvious asymmetry between the keys and queries.\n",

        "A good starting point is thinking though whether a tiny model could do this, e.g. a <a href=\"https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html\">1L Attn-Only model</a>. I'm pretty sure the answer is no! Attention is really good at the primitive operations of looking nearby, or copying information. I can believe a tiny model could figure out that at `to` it should look for names and predict that those names came next (e.g. the skip trigram \" John...to -> John\"). But it's much harder to tell how <i>many</i> of each previous name there are - attending to each copy of John will look exactly the same as attending to a single John token. So this will be pretty hard to figure out on the \" to\" token!\n",

        "The natural place to break this symmetry is on the second `\" John\"` token - telling whether there is an earlier copy of the <i>current</i> token should be a much easier task. So I might expect there to be a head which detects duplicate tokens on the second `\" John\"` token, and then another head which moves that information from the second `\" John` token to the `\" to\"` token.\n",

        "The model then needs to learn to predict `\" Mary\"` and <i>not</i> `\" John\"`. I can see two natural ways to do this:\n",
        "1. Detect all preceding names and move this information to \" to\" and then delete the any name corresponding to the duplicate token feature. This feels easier done with a non-linearity, since precisely cancelling out vectors is hard, so I'd imagine an MLP layer deletes the `\" John\"` direction of the residual stream.\n",
        "2. Have a head which attends to all previous names, but where the duplicate token features <i>inhibit</i> it from attending to specific names. So this only attends to Mary. And then the output of this head maps to the logits.\n",

        "A test that could distinguish these two is to look at which components of the model add directly to the logits - if it's mostly attention heads which attend to `\" Mary\"` and to neither `\" John\"` it's probably hypothesis 2, if it's mostly MLPs it's probably hypothesis 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "And we should be able to identify duplicate token heads by finding ones which attend from `\" John\"` to `\" John\"`, and whose outputs are then moved to the `\" to\"` token by V-Composition with another head (Spoiler: It's more complicated than that!)\n",

Importantly, this means that any linear function of the residual stream can be perfectly decomposed into the contribution of each layer of the transformer. Further, each attention layer's output can be broken down into the sum of the output of each head (See [A Mathematical Framework for Transformer Circuits](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html) for details), and each MLP layer's output can be broken down into the sum of the output of each neuron (and a bias term for each layer).\n",

        "LayerNorm is an analogous normalization technique to BatchNorm (that's friendlier to massive parallelization) that transformers use. Every time a transformer layer reads information from the residual stream, it applies a LayerNorm to normalize the vector at each position (translating to set the mean to 0 and scaling to set the variance to 1) and then applying a learned vector of weights and biases to scale and translate the normalized vector. This is *almost* a linear map, apart from the scaling step, because that divides by the norm of the vector and the norm is not a linear function. (The `fold_ln` flag when loading a model factors out all the linear parts).\n",

And the scale of the residual stream is a global property that's a function of *all* components of the stream, while in practice there is normally just a few directions relevant to any particular component, so in practice this is an acceptable approximation. So when doing direct logit attribution we use the `apply_ln` flag on the `cache` to apply the global layernorm scaling factor to each constant.

This supports the claim in [A Mathematical Framework](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html) that attention heads are the right level of abstraction to understand attention. It also really surprising that there are *negative* heads - eg 10.7 makes the incorrect logit 7x *more* likely. I'm not sure what's going on there, though the paper discusses some possibilities."

Especially later on in the model, there may be components in the residual stream that are nothing to do with the input token! Eg the period at the end of a sentence may contain summary information for that sentence, and the head may solely move that, rather than caring about whether it ends in \".\", \"!\" or \"?\"\n",

        "The setup of activation patching is to take two runs of the model on two different inputs, the clean run and the corrupted run. The clean run outputs the correct answer and the corrupted run does not. The key idea is that we give the model the corrupted input, but then **intervene** on a specific activation and **patch** in the corresponding activation from the clean run (ie replace the corrupted activation with the clean activation), and then continue the run. And we then measure how much the output has updated towards the correct answer.\n",

But if we can identify precisely which parts of the model matter, we can then zoom in and determine what they represent and how they connect up with each other, and ultimately reverse engineer the underlying circuit that they represent."

The results of denoising are much stronger, because showing that a component or set of components is sufficient for a task is a big deal. On the other hand, the complexity of transformers and interdependence of components means that noising a model can have unpredictable consequences. If loss goes up when we ablate a component, it doesn't necessarily mean that this component was necessary for the task. As an example, ablating MLP0 in gpt2-small seems to make performance much worse on basically any task (because it acts as a kind of extended embedding; more on this later in these exercises), but it's not doing anything important which is *specfic* for the IOI task."

Patching by replacing corrupted residual stream values with clean values is a causal intervention which will allow us to understand precisely which parts of the network are identifying the indirect object.

This is because sometimes hooks fail to be removed (if they cause an error while running). There's nothing more frustrating than fixing a hook error only to get the same error message, not realising that you've failed to clear the broken hook!"

        "\n",
        "It's often observed on GPT-2 Small that MLP0 matters a lot, and that ablating it utterly destroys performance. The current accepted hypothesis is that the first MLP layer is essentially acting as an **extension of the embedding**, and that when later layers want to access the input tokens they mostly read in the output of the first MLP layer, rather than the token embeddings. Within this frame, the first attention layer doesn't do much.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this framing, it makes sense that MLP0 matters on `S2`, because that's the one position with a different input token (i.e. it has a different extended embedding between the two prompt versions, and all other tokens will have basically the same extended embeddings).\n",
        "\n",
        "Why does this happen? It seems like most of the effect comes from the fact that **the embedding and unembedding matrices in GPT2-Small are tied**, i.e. the one equals the transpose of the other. On one hand this seems principled - if two words mean similar things (e.g. \"big\" and \"large\") then they should be substitutable, i.e. have similar embeddings and unembeddings. This would seem to suggest that the geometric structure of the embedding and unembedding spaces should be related. On the other hand, there's one major reason why this isn't as principled as it seems - the embedding and the unembedding together form the direct path (if we had no other components then the transformer would just be the linear map $x \\to x^T W_E W_U$), and we do not want this to be symmetric because bigram prediction isn't symmetric! As an example, if $W_E = W_U^T$ then in order to predict \"Barack Obama\" as a probable bigram, we'd also have to predict \"Obama Barack\" with equally high probability, which obviously shouldn't happen. So it makes sense that the first MLP layer might be used in part to overcome this asymmetry: we now think of $\\operatorname{MLP}_0(x^T W_E) W_U$ as the direct path, which is no longer symmetric when $W_E$ and $W_U$ are tied."

        "Decomposing attention layers into patching in individual heads has already helped us localise the behaviour a lot. But we can understand it further by decomposing heads. An attention head consists of two semi-independent operations - calculating *where* to move information from and to (represented by the attention pattern and implemented via the QK-circuit) and calculating *what* information to move (represented by the value vectors and implemented by the OV circuit). We can disentangle which of these is important by patching in just the attention pattern *or* the value vectors. See [A Mathematical Framework](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html) or [Neel's walkthrough video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV5gbOmHbjU) for more on this decomposition."

        "Rather than just having duplicate token heads in the first cluster of heads, we have two other types of heads as well: previous token heads and induction heads. The induction heads do the same thing as the duplicate token heads, via an induction mechanism. They cause token `S2` to attend to `S1+1` (mediated by the previous token heads), and their output is used as both a pointer to `S1` and as a signal that `S1` is duplicated (more on the distinction between these two in the paragraph \"Position vs token information being moved\" below).\n",

        "Why are induction heads used in this circuit? We'll dig into this more in the bonus section, but one likely possibility is that induction heads are just a thing that forms very early on in training by default, and so it makes sense for the model to repurpose this already-existing machinery for this job. See [this paper](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/in-context-learning-and-induction-heads/index.html) for more on induction heads, and how / why they form."

It turns out that when we **ablate** the name mover heads, these ones pick up the slack and do the task anyway (even though they don't seem to do it when the NMHs aren't ablated). This is an example of **built-in redundancy** in the model. One possible explanation is that this resulted from the model being trained with dropout, although this explanation isn't fully satisfying (models trained without dropout still seem to have BNMHs, although they aren't as strong as they are in this model).

        "When we did activation patching on the keys and values of S-inhibition heads, we found that the values were important and the keys weren't. We concluded that K-composition isn't really happening in these heads, and `END` must be paying attention to `S2` for reasons other than the duplicate token information (e.g. it might just be paying attention to the closest name, or to any names which aren't separated from it by a comma). Although this is mostly true, it turns out that there is a bit of K-composition happening in these heads. We can think of this as the duplicate token heads writing the \"duplicated\" flag to the residual stream (without containing any information about the identity and position of this token), and this flag is being used by the keys of the S-inhibition heads (i.e. they make `END` pay attention to `S2`). In the diagram, this is represented by the dark grey boxes (rather than just the light grey boxes we had in the simplified version). We haven't seen any evidence for this happening yet, but we will in the next section (when we look at path patching).\n",

If we didn't count MLPs as a direct path then we wouldn't catch this causal relationship. The drawback is that things get a bit messier, because now we're essentially passing a \"fake input\" into our MLPs, and it's dangerous to assume that any operation as clean as the one previously described (with vectors $v$, $w$) would still happen under these new circumstances.\n",

We compute the proportion of samples that contain the input name token in the top 5 logits (N = 1000) and call this the copy score.

        "* You can apply MLPs and layernorms as functions, by just indexing the model's blocks (e.g. use `model.blocks[i].mlp` or `model.blocks[j].ln1` as a function). Remember that `ln1` is the layernorm that comes before attention, and `ln2` comes before the MLP.\n",
        "* Remember that you need to apply MLP0 before you apply the OV matrix (which is why we omit the 0th layer in our scores). The reason for this is that ablating MLP0 has a strangely large effect in gpt2-small relative to ablating other MLPs, possibly because it's acting as an extended embedding (see [here](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/yivyHaCAmMJ3CqSyj/p/XNjRwEX9kxbpzWFWd#:~:text=GPT%2D2%20Small%E2%80%99s%20performance%20is%20ruined%20if%20you%20ablate%20MLP0) for an explanation).\n",

Unfortunately, they don't seem to be induction heads according to the results of figure 18 in the paper (which we replicated in the section \"validation of early heads\").\n",

A more rigorous way to test this would be to path patch to the keys of these heads, and see if either of the previous token heads have a large effect. If they do, this is very strong evidence for induction. However, it turns out that neither of the prev token heads affect the model's IOI performance via their path through the fuzzy induction heads. Does this invalidate our hypothesis?\n",
        "\n",
        "In fact, no, because of nonlinearity. The two prev token heads `2.2` and `4.11` will be adding onto the **logits** used to calculate the attention probability from `S2` to `S1+1`, rather than adding onto the probabilities directly. SO it might be the case that one head on its own doesn't increase the attention probability very much, both both heads acting together significantly increase it. (Motivating example: suppose we only had 2 possible source tokens, without either head acting the logits are `[0.0, -8.0]`, and the action of each head is to add `4.0` to the second logit. If one head acts then the probability on the second token goes from basically zero to `0.018` (which will have a very small impact on the attention head's output), but if both heads are acting then the logits are equal and the probability is `0.5` (which obviously has a much larger effect)).\n",

The same effect can be found when we patch from these heads to all four induction heads, although it's even more pronounced (a 3% and 15% drop respectively for the heads individually, vs 31% for both).\n",

If we run the model but intervene to set a specific head to zero, what happens? If the model is robust to this intervention, then naively we can be confident that the head is not doing anything important, and conversely if the model is much worse at the task this suggests that head was important. There are several conceptual flaws with this approach, making the evidence only suggestive, e.g. that the average output of the head may be far from zero and so the knockout may send it far from expected activations, breaking internals on *any* task.

Relative positional information on the other hand will mostly have fewer dimensions. Since the model only needs to move enough information to single out a single positional index from about 15-20, rather than single out a name in the entire set of names.
