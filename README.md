# ARENA
why is this so dense

I need to remove theory so that my code is easily visible.

For some reason 1.4.2 doesn't work so I'll figure that shit out.

Reference code for whenever I get confused about:
DLA
Path and Activation Patching
Steering Vectors
(Linear Probes) Upcoming
(SAEs) Upcoming
TransformerLens in general??

Will polish some time later.
